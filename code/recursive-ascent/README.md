# Code for Writing a Recursive Ascent Parser

This directory contains the full code from my
[Writing a Recursive Ascent Parser](https://ryanmartin.me/articles/recursive-ascent)
blog post.

## Get Started

The code is a single python script. It uses type hints, so you'll need at least
Python 3.5 to run it:

```bash
# to run the interpreter
python3 recursive-ascent.py '1 + 2'

# to run the test suite
python3 recursive-ascent.py test
```
