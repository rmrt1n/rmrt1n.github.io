This site is built using [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/). I've tried a lot of web
frameworks but I always end up back with 11ty. It's simple, flexible, has a lot of useful plugins,
and just gets the job done. The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Fonts used are based on a slightly modified [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com/).
Heading text uses transitional typefaces and body text uses neo-grotesque typefaces. Code blocks are
set in [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono).
