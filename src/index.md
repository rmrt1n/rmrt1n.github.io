I'm Ryan Martin, a developer, designer, writer, hacker, tech enthusiast and
~~night owl~~ coffee drinker. Currently I'm based in Kuala Lumpur, studying for
the final year of my bachelor's at
[Asia Pacific University](https://new.apu.edu.my/){target=\_blank}.

I consider myself a generalist, and I like to delve into different fields, such
as web development, data science, cybersecurity, climatetech, ux design, etc. I
then apply learnings from these different disciplines to build things that
create positive impact for people and the planet.

Sometimes I build side projects for fun or to learn a new technology. Nowadays I
usually work on web applications, such as this
[NFT explorer](https://github.com/rmrt1n/starknet-data-aggregator){target=\_blank}
or this [e-ticketing system](https://github.com/rmrt1n/e-ticket){target=\_blank},
but previously I used to (and still do) like building system programs such as
[compilers](https://github.com/rmrt1n/seacucumber){target=\_blank},
[VMs](https://github.com/rmrt1n/govm){target=\_blank}, and
[databases](https://github.com/rmrt1n/redis-kw){target=\_blank}. You can find all
of my projects as well as my tech stack on my
[GitHub page](https://github.com/rmrt1n/redis-kw){target=\_blank}.

Every once in a while I write articles for
[my blog](https://blog.ryanmartin.me){target=\_blank}. Most of them are about
things I'm interested in or solutions to some of the problems I've encountered
before. Below are some highlighted posts:

- [Container Volumes on Selinux
  Systems](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/selinux-containers){target=\_blank}
- [Tagged Unions in C](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/tagged-unions){target=\_blank}
- [Simple Bottom Up Parsing With Recursive
  Ascent](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/recursive-ascent){target=\_blank}

I spend most of my time staring at screens, either building side projects or
exploring new products and technologies. Other than that I usually listen to
music and try to finish my reading list.

I love CTFs, and I've joined a lot of them in the past few years, so I thought
I'd hide some flags in this website just for fun. I've hidden 3 flags for now,
but I might add more in the future. If you have no experience in CTFs, this
should be a exercise to get to know the field!
