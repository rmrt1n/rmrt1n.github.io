Hi 👋, I'm Ryan Martin.  
I build impactful products through design and development.
===

I'm a software engineer + product designer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I specialize
in bringing innovative ideas to life through the entire product development
process - from 🔍 discovery to 🚀 launch. I'm particularly interested in leveraging technology to drive positive change, especially in the field of 🌍 climate tech.
Currently I'm studying for the final year of my 🎓 bachelor's degree at
[APU](https://new.apu.edu.my/){target=\_blank}.

### Other projects

I build side projects for fun or to learn a new technology. Nowadays I
usually work on web applications, such as this
[🔍 NFT explorer](https://github.com/rmrt1n/starknet-data-aggregator){target=\_blank}
or this [👾 cybersecurity learning platform](https://github.com/rmrt1n/cybernaut-2){target=\_blank},
but previously I used to (and still do) like building system programs such as
[compilers](https://github.com/rmrt1n/seacucumber){target=\_blank},
[VMs](https://github.com/rmrt1n/govm){target=\_blank}, and
[databases](https://github.com/rmrt1n/redis-kw){target=\_blank}. You can find all
of my projects as well as my tech stack on my
[GitHub page](https://github.com/rmrt1n){target=\_blank}.

## Fun Facts

I spend most of my time staring at screens, either 🏗️ building side projects or
🔍 exploring new products and technologies. When I'm not doing that, I like to
listen to 🎧 music and try to finish my 📚 reading list.

I'm a big fan of 🚩 CTFs and have participated in many over the past few years.
As a fun challenge, I've hidden three flags on this website. You don't need any
prior experience with CTFs to give it a shot - it could be a great way to get
familiar with the field!
