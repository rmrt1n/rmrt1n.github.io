Hi 👋, I'm Ryan Martin.  
I build impactful products through design and development.
===

I'm a 💻 software engineer + 🎨 product designer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I specialize
in bringing 💡 innovative ideas to life through the entire product development
process - from 🔍 discovery to 🚀 launch. I'm particularly interested in leveraging technology to drive positive change, especially in the field of 🌍 climate tech.
Currently I'm studying for the final year of my 🎓 bachelor's degree at
[APU](https://new.apu.edu.my/){target=\_blank}.

### Other projects

I build side projects for fun or to learn a new technology. Nowadays I
usually work on web applications, such as this
[NFT explorer](https://github.com/rmrt1n/starknet-data-aggregator){target=\_blank}
or this [cybersecurity learning platform](https://github.com/rmrt1n/cybernaut-2){target=\_blank},
but previously I used to (and still do) like building system programs such as
[compilers](https://github.com/rmrt1n/seacucumber){target=\_blank},
[VMs](https://github.com/rmrt1n/govm){target=\_blank}, and
[databases](https://github.com/rmrt1n/redis-kw){target=\_blank}. You can find all
of my projects as well as my tech stack on my
[GitHub page](https://github.com/rmrt1n){target=\_blank}.

## Blog

Every once in a while I write articles for
[my blog](https://blog.ryanmartin.me){target=\_blank}. Most of them are about
things I'm interested in or solutions to some of the problems I've encountered
before. Have a look at some of my more notable posts:

- [Container Volumes on Selinux
  Systems](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/selinux-containers){target=\_blank}
- [Tagged Unions in C](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/tagged-unions){target=\_blank}
- [Simple Bottom Up Parsing With Recursive
  Ascent](https://blog.ryanmartin.me/recursive-ascent){target=\_blank}

## Fun Facts

I spend most of my time staring at screens, either building side projects or
exploring new products and technologies. Other than that I usually listen to
music and try to finish my reading list.

I love CTFs, and I've joined a lot of them in the past few years, so I thought
I'd hide some flags in this website just for fun. I've hidden 3 flags for now,
but I might add more in the future. If you have no experience in CTFs, this
should be a exercise to get to know the field!
