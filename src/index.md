Hi there ðŸ‘‹.

I'm a software developer from Indonesia. I'm interested in foundational
software, cybersecurity, and the craft of software engineering â€” from compilers
to command lines to user-facing apps. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, playing
pool, and exploring good food and drinks.

Currently I'm working on the core systems behind the
<a href="https://github.com/argus-labs/world-engine">World Engine</a>, an SDK
for building onchain games, at <a href="https://argus.gg">Argus Labs</a>.

<!-- placeholder for any previous exp -->

Occasionally, I write (mostly technical) articles about the things I've
learned. Here are a few recent ones:

<ul style="margin-left: 1rem">
  {% assign articles = collections.articles | sort: 'data.published' | reverse %}
  {%- for article in articles limit:3 -%}
    <li style="margin-top: .25rem;">
      <a href="{{ article.page.url }}">{{ article.data.title}}</a>
    </li>
  {%- endfor -%}
</ul>
