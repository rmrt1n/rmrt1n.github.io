Hi, I'm a developer, designer, and writer based in Indonesia. I work at the
intersection of product and engineering, shaping ideas and making them real. I
enjoy systems programming, web development, and tinkering with new technologies.

Currently I'm working on developer tooling for the
<a href="https://github.com/argus-labs/world-engine">World Engine</a>, an SDK
for building onchain games, at <a href="https://argus.gg">Argus Labs</a>.
